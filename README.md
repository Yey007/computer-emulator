# computer-emulator
Emulator written in Rust for my own 4-bit architecture. My hope is to one day build this architecture, or a simpler, stripped-down version, in real life or some sort of logic simulator.

## Project Structure
The folder structure looks roughly as follows: \
. \
├── `assembler` - contains the assembler that can be used to generate binaries to load into the emulator \
├── `common` - contains common pieces between the assembler and emulator like architectural information and utility structs. \
├── `emulator` - contains the emulator itself and some external devices, which can be simulated along with the emulator. \
└── `programs` - contains programs that can be assembled and run.

## Architecture
The design was inspired somewhat by the TMS1000 series. There are four general-purpose registers, including the accumulator. Using two of them registers, up to 256 nibbles of RAM can be addressed. The architecture also supports up to 1024 bytes (1KB) of ROM (64 bytes within a page, for a total of 1024 across 16 pages). Port-mapped GPIO is also possible with 4, 4-bit ports and 4 single-bit pins. Finally, though the architecture doesn't have a stack, it supports calling one subroutine at a time.
